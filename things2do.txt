- Deal with lingering socket on exit.

- Signal handlers to kill forked processes off cleanly on exit.
   * Somewhat fixed; on client disconnect, things are closed up okay,
     and it waits for client to come back.

- Test logic to run external programs on escape sequence.

- Put a semaphore lock around socket so input to QT is serialized
  between TTY and external program execution feedback.
    * Might not be needed; seems that send() should take care of
      serialization.  Kept in as a note to test.

- Add logging, way to track messaging; detach from STDIO in daemon
  mode once logging is present.
    * Almost everything now going to stdout.
    * Need to test as Daemon.
